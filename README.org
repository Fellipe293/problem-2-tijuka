#+Title: Problem 1

Código Inicial em Common Lisp e arquivo de dados.

* Descrição 

This file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000
(inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.

Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given,
where the ith row of the file indicates the ith entry of an array.
Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the fast
divide-and-conquer algorithm covered in the lectures. 

We do not require you to submit your code, so feel free to use any
programming language you want.

TIP: before submitting, first test the correctness of your program on
some small test files or your own devising. Then post your best test
cases to the discussion forums to help your fellow students!
